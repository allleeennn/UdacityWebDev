# UdacityWebDev

My first ever project on Web Development. Learning from Udacity Web Development Course. The site is built on Google App Engine. Still trying to make it cooler.

-Now I'm in the Lesson 2, building with python. Nothing special so far, just trying to keep pace with the course.

-Finished Lesson3. I used bootstrap and basic html to build a simple front page for my portfolio, and depolyed on google app engine. http://first-python-gae-app.appspot.com/
